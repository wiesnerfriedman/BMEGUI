function [zk]=kernelsmoothing(ck,ch,zh,v,nhmax,dmax,options);% kernelsmoothing           - prediction using a Gaussian kernel smoothing (Jan 1,2001)%% Estimate at a set of locations the values of a variable, based on% the knowledge of the hard data values at another set of locations.% The method used here is a Gaussian kernel smoothing. The estimated % value at a location is a weighted linear combination of hard data% values at surrounding locations. The weights are positive and % proportional to the values of a Gaussian distribution evaluated at% the Euclidean distances between the estimation locations and the% locations where hard data values are known.  %% SYNTAX :%% [zk]=kernelsmoothing(ck,ch,zh,v,nhmax,dmax,options); %% INPUT :%% ck       nk by d   matrix of coordinates for the estimation locations.%                    A line corresponds to the vector of coordinates at%                    an estimation location, so the number of columns in%                    ck corresponds to the dimension of the space. There%                    is no restriction on the dimension of the space.% ch       nh by d   matrix of coordinates for the hard data locations,%                    with the same convention as for ck.% zh       nh by 1   vector of values for the hard data at the coordinates%                    specified in ch.% v        scalar    variance of the isotropic Gaussian kernel distribution.%                    A higher values for v provides a higher smoothing for%                    the zk estimates.% nhmax    scalar    maximum number of hard data values that are considered for the%                    computations at each estimation location.% dmax     scalar    maximum distance between an estimation location and existing hard%                    data locations. All hard data locations separated by a distance%                    smaller than dmax from an estimation location will be included in%                    the estimation process for that location, whereas other hard data%                    locations are neglected.% options  scalar    optional parameter that can be used if default value is not%                    satisfactory (otherwise this vector can simply be omitted from the%                    input list of variables). options is equal to 1 or 0, depending if%                    the user wants or does not want to display the order number of the%                    location which is currently processed by the function. %% OUTPUT :%% zk       nk by 1   vector of estimated values at the estimation locations. Values coded%                    as NaN mean that no estimation has been performed at that location,%                    due to the lack of available data in the neighbourhood.%%%%%% Initialize the parametersif nargin<7,  options(1)=0;end;nk=size(ck,1);           % nk is the number of estimation pointsnh=size(ch,1);           % nh is the number of hard datazk=zeros(nk,1)*NaN;if options(1)==1,  num2strnk=num2str(nk);end;%%%%%% Main loop starts herefor i=1:nk,  ck0=ck(i,:);  [chlocal,zhlocal,dh,sumnhlocal]=neighbours(ck0,ch,zh,nhmax,dmax);  if sumnhlocal>0,    lam=gausspdf(dh,[0,v]);    lam=lam/sum(lam);    zk(i)=lam'*zhlocal;  end;  if options(1)==1,    disp([num2str(i),'/',num2strnk]);  end;end;

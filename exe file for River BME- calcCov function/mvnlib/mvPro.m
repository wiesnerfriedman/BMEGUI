% mvPro                     - Multi-Variate integrals arising from calculation of Probabilities (Jan 1, 2001)
%
% Uses a numerical integration to calculate a multivariate integral arising
% from the calculation of probabilities in statistics. The form of the integral
% to calculate is as follow
%  b
% I dXs fs(Xs) mvnpdf(Xs,Mean,Cov),
%  a
% where Xs is a vector of N variables, fs(.) is a N-dimentional function,
% and mvnpdf(.) is a N-dimentional multi-variate normal pdf with mean vector 
% Mean, and covariance matrix Cov. The integration limits are given by 
% a and b. Note that fs is a pdf defined 
% by the soft probabilistic data variables softpdftype, nl, limi and probdens
% (see probasyntax for more explanation on soft probabilistic data)
%
% If the number of dimensions for the integral is greater or equal to 2,
% then the AG2 (Adaptative Genz 2) algorithm used is the subregion 
% Adaptative integration program dcuhre for multiple integral. See:
% Berntsen, J., O. Espelid and A. Genz, "An Adaptive Multidimensional
% Integration Routine for a Vector of Integrals".
% If the number of dimensions for the integral is equal to 1 (univariate case),
% then a simple interative trapezoidal method is used (see, for example,
% "numerical recipies").

% INPUT :
%
% softpdftype scalar      indicates the type of soft pdf representing the  
%                         function fs.  
%                         softpdftype may take value 1, 2, 3 or 4, as follow:
%                         1 for Histogram, 2 for Linear, 3 for Grid histogram, 
%                         and 4 for Grid Linear. (see probasyntax for more explanations)
% nl          N by 1      vector of the number of interval limits. nl(i) is the number  
%                         of interval limits used to define the soft pdf for the i-th 
%                         dimention of fs. (see probasyntax for more explanations)
% limi        N by l      matrix of interval limits, where l is equal to
%                         either max(nl) or 3 depending of the softpdftype.
%                         limi(i,:) are the limits of intervals for the i-th 
%                         dimension of fs. (see probasyntax for more explanations)
% probdens    N by q      matrix of probability density values fs, where q is 
%                         equal to either max(nl)-1 or max(nl), depending on the 
%                         softpdftype. probdens(i,:) are the values of the probability 
%                         density corresponding to the intervals for the i-th dimension 
%                         defined in limi(i,:). (see probasyntax for more explanations)
% Mean        N by 1      vector of N means    
% C           N by N      covariance matrix
% maxpts      scalar      maximum number of function values allowed.
% aEps        scalar      absolute error tolerance.
% rEps        scalar      relative error tolerance.

% OUTPUT when N>1 :
%
% Val         nMom by 1  estimated values for the multiple integrals
% Err         nMom by 1  estimated absolute error, with 99% confidence level.
% Info        scalar      Info = 0, normal completion with ERR < EPS;
%                         Info = 1, completion with ERR > EPS and MAXPTS function 
%                             values used; increase MAXPTS to decrease ERROR;
%                         Info = 2 to 11: see IFAIL in source code dcuhre.f

% Val         1 by nMom   estimated values for the multiple integrals
% Err         1 by nMom   estimated absolute error.
% Info        1 by nMom   vector of end of computation status
%                         info = 0 for normal exit, when Error <=  aEps or
%                                  Error <=  abs(Value)*rEps 
%                         info = 1 too many iterations necessary to obtain 
%                                  the required accuracy.

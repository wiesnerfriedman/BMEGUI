% BMEprobaTCI               - BME Confidence Interval and posterior pdf with transform (Jan 1, 2001)
%
% BME computation of the confidence interval (CI) and the BME posterior pdf 
% at a set of estimation points, using both hard and soft probabilistic data 
% and a data transformation toward a multivariate Gaussian.
% The transformation of the original Random Field Y to the
% transformed Random Field Z, Y->Z, is such that Z is supposed to be 
% multivariate normal.  The solution provide the CI and BME posterior pdf
% on the original scale Y.
% This function is intendend to be as general as possible, covering
% various situations, like multi field variables, nested models, 
% space-time estimations, non-stationarity of the mean, etc. 
% Depending on the case, specific format are needed for the input variables. 
% In the most simple case the CI is just one interval with lower bound zlCI and 
% upper bound zuCI, but in general the CI may be composed of the union of several 
% disconnected intervals, in which case zlCI and zuCI store the minimum of the
% lower bounds and maximum of the upper bounds of these intervals, respectively.

% ck          nk by d     matrix of coordinates for the estimation locations.
%                         A line corresponds to the vector of coordinates at
%                         an estimation location, so the number of columns
%                         corresponds to the dimension of the space. There is
%                         no restriction on the dimension of the space.
% ch          nh by d     matrix of coordinates for the hard data locations,
%                         with the same convention as for ck.
% cs          ns by d     matrix of coordinates for the soft data locations,
%                         with the same convention as for ck.
% yh          nh by 1     vector of the values for the hard data for Y
%ysoftpdftype scalar      indicates the type of soft pdf for the variable Y   
%                         representing the probabilitic soft data at the 
%                         coordinates specified in cs.  
%                         softpdftype may take value 1, 2, 3 or 4, as follow:
%                         1 for Histogram, 2 for Linear, 3 for Grid histogram, 
%                         and 4 for Grid Linear. (see probasyntax for more explanations)
% ynl         ns by 1     vector of the number of interval limits. nl(i) is the number  
%                         of interval limits used to define the soft pdf for soft data 
%                         point i. (see probasyntax for more explanations)
% ylimi       ns by l     matrix of interval limits for variable Y, where l is equal to
%                         either max(nl) or 3 depending of the softpdftype.
%                         limi(i,:) are the limits of intervals for the i-th 
%                         soft data. (see probasyntax for more explanations)
% yprobdens   ns by p     matrix of probability density values, where p is 
%                         equal to either max(nl)-1 or max(nl), depending on the 
%                         softpdftype. probdens(i,:) are the values of the probability 
%                         density corresponding to the intervals for the i-th soft data 
%                         defined in limi(i,:). (see probasyntax for more explanations)
% covmodel   string       string that contains the name of the covariance model 
%                         for the Gaussian-transformed Z data.
%                         (see the modelslib directory for a list of available models)
%                         Variogram models are not available for this function.
%                         See modelsyntax for more explanations on covariance models.
% covparam   1 by k       vector of values for the parameters of covmodel, according
%                         to the convention for the corresponding covariance model.
% nhmax      scalar       maximum number of hard data values that are considered
%                         for the estimation at the locations specified in ck.
% nsmax      scalar       maximum number of soft data values that are considered for
%                         the estimation at the locations specified in ck. As the
%                         computation time is exponentially increasing with nsmax,
%                         it is not advised to use more than few soft data locations.
%                         In any case, nsmax should be lower than 20 in order to
%                         avoid numerical computation problems.
% dmax       scalar       maximum distance between an estimation location and
%                         existing hard/soft data locations. All hard/soft data
%                         locations separated by a distance smaller than dmax from an
%                         estimation location will be included in the estimation process
%                         for that location, whereas other data locations are neglected.
% order      scalar       order of the polynomial drift along the spatial axes at the
%                         estimation locations. For the zero-mean case, NaN (Not-a-Number)
%                         is used.
%                         order=Nan for a zero mean
%                              =0 for a constant mean
%                              =1 for a constant+linear mean along each axis
%                              =2 for a constant+linear+quadratic mean along each axis, etc.
% options    1 by 1 or 29 vector of optional parameters that can be used if default
%                         values are not satisfactory (otherwise this vector can simply be
%                         omitted from the input list of variables), where :
%                         options(1), options(2) and options(14) are values used by the
%                         fminbnd.m MATLAB optimization routine that finds the mode of the

%                         as for fminbnd.m),
%                         options(3) specifies the maximum number of evaluation that can
%                         be done by the FORTRAN77 subroutines for the integrals (default
%                         value is 50 000 ; this value should be increased if a warning
%                         message appears on the screen during the computation),
%                         options(4) specifies the maximum admissible relative error on the
%                         estimation of these integrals (default value is 1e-4).  
%                         options(6) is used to determine how fine of a grid of z values to
%                         construct (default value is 25 ; increase this value to construct 
%                         a finer grid),
%                         options(7) is used to determine the extend of the grid of z values
%                         to construct (default value is 0.001 ; decrease this value to widen
%                         the range of the grid of z values), 
%                         options(20:29) confidence probability for which to compute the confidence 
%                         interval. The CI are calculated only for options(20:29) which 
%                         are >=0.01 and <=0.99. The default value is options(20)=0.68 and 
%                         options(21:29)=0
% yfile      k by 1       vector of values for Y sorted in ascending order
% cdfyfile   k by 1       vector of values of the cumulative distribution for Y
%                         The values of cdfyfile must be strickly increasing, 
%                         between 0 and 1, and cdfyfile(1)<0.001 and cdfyfile>0.999 so that 
%                         yfile covers most of the range of Y values.
